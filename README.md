## 🎯 Overview

> **📌 Note**: This system is currently in active development. While core features are functional, some features may be incomplete or subject to change.

### 🚕 Taxi Meter Backend

**Taxi Meter Backend** is a **multi-tenant SaaS backend** built to power digital taxi meter systems for independent taxi companies.
The system enables multiple taxi companies (tenants) to operate independently within a single platform while maintaining strict data isolation and role-based access control. Each tenant manages its own drivers, rides, pricing policies, and payment provider integrations.

#### 🎯 The backend is designed to:

- ✅ Handle real-time ride lifecycle management
- ✅ Perform authoritative fare calculations
- ✅ Process payments via Stripe Connect and Viva Wallet
- ✅ Enforce tenant-level data isolation
- ✅ Provide reporting and analytics for administrators
- ✅ Support secure driver authentication for mobile applications

#### 👥 This backend serves:

| Role                     | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🧑‍💼 **Administrators**    | Taxi company administrators (web admin portal) |
| 🚗 **Drivers**           | Drivers (mobile application)                   |
| 💳 **Payment Providers** | Payment providers (via OAuth + webhooks)       |

## 🏗 Architecture Philosophy

This backend follows a **multi-tenant, stateless, API-first architecture**:

### 🔐 Multi-Tenant Isolation

Every ride, payment, driver, and pricing policy is strictly scoped to a tenant.

### 🔄 Stateless Authentication

JWT-based authentication ensures horizontal scalability and containerized deployment readiness.

### 💰 Server-Authoritative Financial Logic

All fare calculations and payment state transitions are handled server-side to guarantee financial integrity.

### ⚡ Idempotent Payment Processing

Webhook handling prevents duplicate processing and ensures consistency in distributed payment workflows.
